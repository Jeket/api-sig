General
=======

This topic document serves to provide guidance on general topics of
style and approaches to developing and managing public HTTP APIs.

Guidelines
----------

1. While every public API should have a canonical client
   implementation we should discourage tight bindings between an API
   and its clients and strongly encourage separate evolution of
   the API and its official client. We welcome any effort aimed at
   developing and promoting alternative clients. A diversity of
   implementations is healthy and enables use in many environments.
