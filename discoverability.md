API Discoverability
===================

This topic document serves to provide guidance on how to have a public REST
API expose the URIs and resources to end users in a machine-readable way.

See also the topic document on [compatibility](compatibility.md).

Guidance
--------

**TODO** Add sections that describe a best practice for API discoverability,
possibly using JSON-Home, JSONSchema documents, and JSON-HAL.
