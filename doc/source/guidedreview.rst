=====================
Guided Review Process
=====================

The API Special Interest Group would like to increase the tools available to
OpenStack project teams by defining a process and venue for conducting live
face-to-face reviews. At a high level, these reviews are focused on the
question "does my project align with the guidelines?" and are intended to be
hosted by the API Special Interest Group at the PTG meetups.

On a more concrete level, the API Special Interest Group expects that reviews
which are directed towards specific areas, or problems within, an API will
garner the best results (e.g. "Is using a PUT request for updating these
resources appropriate?", "We are using GET requests to start server actions, is
there a better alternative?").

Ideal Candidates for Review
---------------------------

It may be difficult if not impossible to review the entire API of a project in
a session at the PTG. So here are some suggestions for selecting discussion
topics:

Is there a part of your API that has generated some disagreement on your
team? If so, that would be an excellent subject for discussion at the PTG.

Are you unhappy with how some of your current API works? We could brainstorm
ideas about making it more consistent and usable.

Are you creating a new API? If you're starting a new project, or creating a
new major version for your project, we can discuss what would be the most
effective ways to approach it.

How do I get my project reviewed?
---------------------------------

Here are some things you should prepare before approaching the API working
group for a live review of your project:

1. Pick an area of your API to focus on (e.g. a specific resource type, an
   interaction that is troublesome or endpoints that could use clarification).

2. Prepare a document describing the API in question, this could be free-form
   or something more formal like an OpenAPI specification. This does not need
   to be an expansive document, but should help drive the review conversation
   and provide a reference for the reviewers to understand the flow of the API
   in question.

Then just show up to an API Special Interest Group face-to-face session with
your materials ready. Sending an email ahead of time will help to ensure that
the group is ready for your review but is not strictly necessary.

What should I expect from my review?
------------------------------------

The answer to this will vary depending on the nature of your request to the
group. You should expect to have clarification on the basic question of how
close your API follows the API-SIG's guidelines. But, the depth of your review
will depend entirely on how big a request is made of the review group.

The preparations that a project team makes before the review process will have
the largest effect on the expected outcome. Teams that are more specific and
focused with their requests to the review group will most likely harvest the
greatest fruits from this process.

When considering approaching the API-SIG for a review, we encourage projects to
identify areas of their APIs that could use clarification or have been
problematic to the team. Project teams that have reviewed the API guidelines
and have questions about specific areas of interest will find that their
reviews will be more productive than open-ended questions which cover large
portions of their API.

After a review is completed, the API Special Interest Group will archive the
general details of the review (e.g. "Team <X> requested a review of API
features <Y> and <Z>. It was agreed that actions <A>, <B> and <C> are the best
path forward") and any artifacts that are generated during the process. This
archive will exist in the same repository as the guidelines under a separate
heading for reviews.
