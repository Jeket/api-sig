 The title of your guideline should replace the
 "Example Guideline Template"

==========================
Example Guideline Template
==========================

Introduction paragraph -- what does this guideline address? A single
paragraph of prose that implementors can understand. This paragraph
should describe the intent and scope of the guideline. The title and
this first paragraph should be used as the subject line and body of
the commit message respectively.

Some notes about using this template:

* Your guideline should be in ReSTructured text, like this template.

* Please wrap text at 79 columns.

* Please do not delete any of the sections in this template.  If you have
  nothing to say for a whole section, just write: None

* For help with syntax, see http://sphinx-doc.org/rest.html

* To test out your formatting, build the docs using tox, or see:
  http://rst.ninjs.org

* For help with OpenStack documentation conventions, see
  https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Documentation/Conventions

Guidance
========

A detailed description of the guideline that is being suggested.

* The guideline should provide a clear recitation of the actions to be
  taken by implementors.

* Reference to specific technology implementations (for example,
  XXX-Y.Z package) should be avoided.

* External references should be described by annotations with the
  links to the source material in the References section. (for example,
  please see RFC 0000[1])

Examples
========

A series of examples that demonstrate the proper usage of the guideline
being proposed. These examples may include, but are not limited to:

* JSON objects.

* HTTP methods demonstrating requests and responses.

The examples should not include:

* Code samples designed for implementation.

References
==========

A list of the annotated references from the Guidance section and additional
material that may be relevant to the guideline. For annotated references
these should follow the form of:

    [1]: https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc0000

Additional references may be provided in cases where they aid in giving a
more complete understanding of the guideline. You are not required to have any
references. Moreover, this guideline should still make sense when your
references are unavailable. Examples of what you could include are:

* Links to mailing list or IRC discussions

* Links to notes from a summit session

* Links to relevant research, if appropriate
